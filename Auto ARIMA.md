# Background
Given the visual indication of autocorrelation as well as seasonality, **auto.arima** is used to automatically generate many ARIMA models with differing p, d, and q coordinates â€” the best model is then selected based on the one with the lowest **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion**).
# Information Criterion
